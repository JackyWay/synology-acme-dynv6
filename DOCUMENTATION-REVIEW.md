## Cross-Reference Verification

### Installation Flow Consistency ✅

All documents follow the same installation sequence:

1. Copy files to NAS
2. Configure `.env`
3. Set permissions
4. Start Docker container
5. **Install native acme.sh** ← Critical step, now properly documented
6. Issue certificate
7. Deploy to DSM
8. Configure Task Scheduler

### Architecture Explanation Consistency ✅

All documents explain the hybrid architecture:
- Docker for certificate issuance/renewal
- Native acme.sh for DSM deployment
- Shared `acme-data/` storage
- Access to DSM system tools (synouser, synogroup, synosetkeyvalue)

### Crontab Removal ✅

**Verified:** No crontab references remain in any documentation
- All references changed to "DSM Task Scheduler"
- Warning added: "crontab command is NOT available on Synology DSM"
- Daily renewal logic explained (runs daily, only renews when < 30 days)

## Script Purpose Summary

| Script | Purpose | Requires Root | Uses Docker | Uses Native |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **install-acme-native.sh** | One-time installation of native acme.sh | Yes (sudo) | No | Installs native |
| **issue-cert.sh** | Initial certificate issuance | No | Yes | No |
| **renew-cert.sh** | Check and renew certificate | Yes (sudo) | Yes (renew) | Yes (deploy) |
| **deploy-to-dsm.sh** | Deploy certificate to DSM | Yes (sudo) | No | Yes |

## Pattern Matching Verification

### Script Names ✅
All script names are consistent across all documentation:
- `scripts/install-acme-native.sh`
- `scripts/issue-cert.sh`
- `scripts/renew-cert.sh`
- `scripts/deploy-to-dsm.sh`

### Paths ✅
All paths are consistent:
- Project path: `/volume1/docker/synology-acme/`
- Native installation: `/usr/local/share/acme.sh/`
- Shared storage: `acme-data/`
- Logs: `logs/`

### Command Examples ✅
All sudo requirements properly documented:
- `sudo ./scripts/install-acme-native.sh` ✅
- `./scripts/issue-cert.sh` ✅ (no sudo)
- `sudo ./scripts/renew-cert.sh` ✅
- `sudo ./scripts/deploy-to-dsm.sh` ✅

## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: plan.md Missing install-acme-native.sh
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:** plan.md was outdated and didn't reflect hybrid architecture
- Missing install-acme-native.sh in script list
- Architecture diagram showed Docker-only approach
- File structure incomplete
- Deployment steps missing native installation

**Resolution:**
- Updated overview to mention hybrid architecture
- Added install-acme-native.sh to Phase 3 (Script Development)
- Rewrote architecture diagram to show Docker + native approach
- Updated file structure to show all 4 scripts
- Updated runtime structure to show native installation paths
- Added hybrid architecture advantages section
- Updated next steps to include all scripts
- Added explanation of problem solved by hybrid approach
